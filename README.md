Stroke Prediction Classification Model

Description:
This project involves building a classification regression model to predict the likelihood of stroke based on various factors such as age, hypertension, smoking status, glucose levels, and BMI. The model uses logistic regression to classify individuals into two categories: stroke or non-stroke. The model achieved an accuracy of 88%.

# Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The accuracy of the model is 88%, with precision and recall for both Class 0 (non-stroke) and Class 1 (stroke) also around 88%. This indicates that the model is performing well.

# Bar Chart Evaluation:

The bar chart displayed in the presentation visualizes the model’s evaluation results, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

 Factors Influencing Stroke

The project also analyzed the factors influencing stroke risk using logistic regression. The key factors and their impacts are:
	•	Hypertension and smoking status have the biggest positive impact on stroke risk.
	•	Work type (Self-employed) has a negative impact on stroke risk.

# Bar Chart of Coefficients:

A bar chart displays these factors clearly, helping to understand which variables influence the model the most.

# Visualizations Matplotlib

** Age vs Stroke Risk:

A bar chart was used to visualize how age influences stroke risk. The chart shows that the risk of stroke increases with age, especially between the ages of 50 and 80.

* Average Glucose Level vs Stroke Risk:

A second chart shows that individuals with higher glucose levels have a greater risk of stroke.

* BMI vs Stroke Risk:

BMI has a less significant effect on stroke risk compared to age and glucose levels, as shown in the visualizations.

# Conclusion

Based on the analysis and visualizations:
	•	Age is the most significant factor influencing stroke risk.
	•	Glucose levels are the second most influential factor.
	•	BMI has a lower impact but is still relevant in the context of stroke prediction.

# This model provides insights into the key risk factors associated with strokes and can assist in healthcare decision-making.
