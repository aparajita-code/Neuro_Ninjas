Project Proposal: Stroke Prediction Analysis
 
Objective:
This project aims to analyze stroke prediction data to determine the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on various factors. By leveraging statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, we seek to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset and develop predictive models.
 
Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes key factors that may influence stroke risk, such as:
              	•  Demographic Information: Sex, age
              	•   Health Conditions: Presence of heart disease, BMI (Body Mass Index)
              	•   Lifestyle Factors: Smoking status
              	•   Other Features: Additional attributes included in the dataset
 
Goals:
              	1. Identify the most significant factors contributing to stroke risk.
              	2. Develop a robust predictive model to estimate stroke likelihood.
                3. Provide actionable insights to inform preventive measures and health interventions.
